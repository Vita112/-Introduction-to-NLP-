## distant supervision for relation extraction via piecewise convolutional neural network 2015
### abstract
+ 2 problems arise when using distant supervision for RE
> 1. heuristic alignment may result in wrong label problem
> 2. the noise generated from the feature extraction process can cause poor performance
+ propose PCNNs with multi-instance learning to address the above 2 problems
> for the 1st, treat distant supervision relation extrction **as a multi-instance learning problem**, taking the uncertainty of instance labels into account

> for the 2nd, adopt convolutional architecture with **piecewise max pooling** to learning relevant features automatically.
### 1 introduction
+ **an assume** in distant supervion
> if 2 entities have a relationship in a known knowledge base, the all sentences that mention these 2 entities will express that relationship in some way.
