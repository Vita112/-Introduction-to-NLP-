**Highlights in this paper**:

1. They decompose the joint extraction task into 2 inner-related subtasks:HE extraction and TER extraction;

2. The proposed 2 subtasks aer deconstructed into several sequence labeling problems based on the span-based tagging scheme

3. following the span-based tagging scheme, They use a general module named HBT(heirarchical boundary tagger) to extract HE and TER, and propose
a multi-span decoding algorithm to adapt to the multi-target extraction task.
